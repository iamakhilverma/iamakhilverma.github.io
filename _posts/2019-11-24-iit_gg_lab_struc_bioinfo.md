Assisted with the in-silico design of small ligand molecules to inhibit early-stage insulin aggregation nucleation. Identified EGCG and polyoxometalates as the putative ligands through extensive literature review, programmed their structures. Performed targeted docking of EGCG into a partially folded intermediate of insulin using Gray labâ€™s ROSIE server.
