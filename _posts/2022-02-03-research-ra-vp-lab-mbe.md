This work highlights how temporal variations in selection pressures during virus adaption may impact the rate and the extent of CpG depletion in virus genomes.
<!-- Depletion of CpG dinucleotides in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes has been linked to virus evolution, host-switching, virus replication, and innate immune responses. Temporal variations, if any, in the rate of CpG depletion during virus evolution in the host remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the CpG content of over 1.4 million full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes representing over 170 million documented infections during the first 17 months of the pandemic. Our findings suggest that the extent of CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is modest. Interestingly, the rate of CpG depletion is highest during early evolution in humans and it gradually tapers off, almost reaching an equilibrium; this is consistent with adaptations to the human host. Furthermore, within the coding regions, CpG depletion occurs predominantly at codon positions 2-3 and 3-1. Loss of ZAP (Zinc-finger antiviral protein)-binding motifs in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is primarily driven by the loss of the terminal CpG within the motifs. Nonetheless, majority of the CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes occurs outside ZAP-binding motifs. SARS-CoV-2 genomes selectively lose CpGs-motifs from a U-rich context; this may help avoid immune recognition by TLR7. SARS-CoV-2 alpha-, beta-, and delta-variants of concern have reduced CpG content compared to sequences from the beginning of the pandemic. In sum, we provide evidence that the rate of CpG depletion in virus genomes is not uniform and it greatly varies over time and during adaptations to the host. This work highlights how temporal variations in selection pressures during virus adaption may impact the rate and the extent of CpG depletion in virus genomes. -->
