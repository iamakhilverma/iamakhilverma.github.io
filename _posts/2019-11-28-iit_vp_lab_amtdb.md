Inspected temporal evolution of mono- and dinucleotides in human mtDNA by analysing sequences dated back to 50k BC. Developed boxplots for samples from earliest-, middle- and latest-period; conducted statistical tests to compare their medians. Our findings suggested that lighter strand is becoming heavier, and a slight bias toward GC-rich sequences in ancient reads.
