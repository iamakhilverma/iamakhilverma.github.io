Analysed single-cell transcriptomic data collected from early mouse embryo mutant carrying a mutation in ASPP-2 gene. Processed sequence data files, mapped sequence reads, performed quality control on the individual cells, normalized the data. Identified cell sub-types using an unbiased hierarchical clustering algorithm and expression values for biological marker genes.
