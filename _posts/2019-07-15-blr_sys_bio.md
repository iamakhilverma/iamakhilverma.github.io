Investigated existing kinetic modelling approaches to translate metabolic networks of interest into a dynamic model. Designed a convenience kinetics based dynamic model comprising 92 reactions, 110 species using complex pathway simulator. Distributed the reactions across 4 compartments and simulated its dynamic characterstics; examined robustness of the model.
