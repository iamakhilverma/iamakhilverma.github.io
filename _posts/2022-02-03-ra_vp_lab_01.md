Investigated the changing dynamics of CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes over time and role of various selection pressures. Led the computational work, clearly defined the objectives beforehand, advocated the use of best-programming practices. Successfully tested all custom written functions, classes by designing exhaustive test-cases for unit testing before using them. Single-handedly refactored the code repository for our project to enhance execution speed, improve code design and readability. Mastered the use of Python, attained proficiency in the use of regular expressions, version control, and test-driven development.
